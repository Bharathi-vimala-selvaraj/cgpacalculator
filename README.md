This project is a Java Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to compute both SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average). It is intended to assist students in accurately calculating their academic performance with a simple, user-friendly tool.

Features
------------
CGPA Calculator: Calculates the cumulative grade point average across multiple semesters based on SGPA and credit inputs.

SGPA Calculator: Computes the semester-wise performance based on individual subject grades and credits.

Java Swing interface for efficient input handling and real-time result display.

Supports multiple entries with input validation for accuracy.

Formulae Used
--------------
SGPA = Σ (Grade Point × Credit) / Σ (Credits)

CGPA = Σ (SGPA × Semester Credits) / Σ (Semester Credits)

Project Highlights
------------------
Focuses on accurate CGPA calculation, making it ideal for cumulative academic analysis.

Demonstrates the conceptual and functional link between SGPA and CGPA.

The CGPA calculator is an extension of SGPA logic, showing how subject-level data scales to semester-level analysis.

Technologies Used
------------------
Java (JDK 8+)

Swing (Java GUI library)

IntelliJ IDEA (for development and execution)
